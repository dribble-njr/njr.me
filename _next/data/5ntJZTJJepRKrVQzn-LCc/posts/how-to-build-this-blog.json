But I use SSR so then changing color mode or init during hydration, and flashing happens.\n\nSo It should [add color mode manager for ssr](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/color-mode#add-colormodemanager-optional-for-ssr).\n\nBut I deploy it on gh-pages that it can only used for static page. It can't use `getServerSideProps`.\n\nSo we have two case to solve this:\n\n1. change deployment way\n2. don't set `initialColorMode` with `system`\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
